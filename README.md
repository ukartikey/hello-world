# hello-world
my first repo.
well now we are in the game of github and trying to figuer out how to use it .
so over here we have something called a branch which basically is nothing but a way to edit and at the same time keep track of what is being done in the file.
we are currently in the feature branch and after doing the changes that we are doing right now we will merge it with the master branch.
